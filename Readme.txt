1.  What test cases are needed, and in what order?
 
	I used the example test case to start with, as well as
	cases for ParseException, CycleDetectedException, and
	UnknownTargetException.  I created three addition cases:
	one with six vertexes, and the other two with 9.
      
   
  

2.  What did you not anticipate (e.g. time allocation, test cases,
    algorithms, methods)?
    
    Initially, I did not consider that there could be unnecessary nodes,
    even when building the whole project.  I added an additional
    field subgraph, modified makeTarget, and added a recursive helper
    method to build the subgraph.
    
    
    
	
3.  What would you do differently next time?

	I would have started earlier.  I could have possibly received a higher
	score by not resubmitting the final corrections after the deadline, 
	but I prefer not to leave it unfinished.
